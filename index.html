			<p>Born and raised in St.Louis, Missouri, Dwynn moved to Kansas City in 2006 to attend the Univeristy of Missouri-Kansas City. While at UMKC, she majored in Urban Planning and Design, volunteered at local organizations such as Harvester and Habitat Restore while also becoming a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. Upon graduating, she continued her work with The Kansas City Public School Repurposing Initiative to promote the reuse and redevelopment of 30 of its closed school sites. </p>
				
			<p>Later working for Mind Mixer, she continued her excitement and commitment to community building by focusing on creating stronger relationships between civic places and the people who love them through transparent, meaningful and productive interactions online. There her excitement for "tech" was birthed. Skilled in Engagement, Crisis Management, Customer Relationship Management, Strategic Planning and Project Management, she is looking to expand her skills with computer programming.</p>
